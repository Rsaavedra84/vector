title: "GeoPandas Advanced Topics"
teaching: 30
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What capabilities does `python-rasterstats` offer for performing analyses of raster data over vector geospatial features?"
- "How does it integrate with Pandas and other common Python tools?"
objectives:
- Explore simple but powerful capabilities offered by `python-rasterstats` to generate summaries and statistics of raster properties over vector features.
- These summaries include statistics for continuous data and value distributions for categorical data.
keypoints:
- The module, `python-rasterstats` offers powerful but simple-to-use capabilities for generating summaries of raster data over both continuos fields and categorical data.
- These summaries are typically tabular in nature and can easily be integrated into Pandas DataFrames and GeoPandas GeoDataFrames for further analysis.
