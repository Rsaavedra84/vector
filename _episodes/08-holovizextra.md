## Going further: The "Holoviz" visualization and dashboarding toolkit
[Friedrich Knuth, University of Washington](https://github.com/friedrichknuth/). 2019-9-9

This notebook demonstrates powerful tools and approaches for interacting with mapped data using the `Holoviz` tool kit. Holoviz supports GeoPandas. Explore it at your leisure! The visualization tutorial will go into more depth on advanced visualization capabilities such as Holoviz.

*Adapted (slightly) from the [Holoviz web site](https://holoviz.org):* HoloViz provides a coordinated set of Python packages that make browser-based visualization easier to use, easier to learn, more accurate, and more powerful: [Panel](https://panel.pyviz.org/) for making apps and dashboards for your plots from any supported plotting library, [hvPlot](https://hvplot.pyviz.org/) to quickly generate interactive plots from your data, [HoloViews](https://holoviews.org/) to help you make all of your data instantly visualizable, [GeoViews](http://geoviews.org/) to extend HoloViews for geographic data, [Datashader](http://datashader.org/) for rendering even the largest datasets, [Param](https://param.pyviz.org/) to create declarative user-configurable objects, and [Colorcet](https://colorcet.pyviz.org/) for perceptually uniform colormaps.

## Open the Jupyter Notebook

- [Open the Jupyter Notebook in nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/geohackweek/tutorial_contents/blob/master/vector/notebooks/geoviews_example.ipynb) to follow along the rendered notebook without running it. But note that you really need to run it live to see it fully in action.
- On pangeo, open and run the notebook `tutorial_contents/vector/notebooks/geoviews_example.ipynb`.
