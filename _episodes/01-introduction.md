## Tutorial provided by Emilio Mayorga, with help from Don Setiawan

## Student Prerequesites
- Python conda installed
- Conda environment will be distributed with `geopandas` and its dependencies, which include (for vector-handling packages) `shapely`, `fiona`, `pyproj`, `descartes` and `pysal`, in addition to `pandas`, `numpy`, etc. These will be handled automatically by the conda environment. Additional conda packages include `geojson`, `folium` (for interactive maps in Jupyter notebooks) and possibly `cartopy` and `mplleaflet`. Finally, `python-rasterstats` for simplified raster-vector analysis, and `psycopg2` for access to vector data stored in PostGIS.
- Ideally some familiarity with GIS concepts regarding vector spatial objects (points, lines, polygons, etc)
